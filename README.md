# AI Portfolio Repository

Welcome to my AI Portfolio Repository! This repository showcases my work as a Data Scientist with expertise in Artificial Intelligence. It contains four main folders, each representing different areas of my projects and contributions. Let's take a brief overview of each folder:

## 1. CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks)

In this folder, you will find projects related to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are a class of deep learning models widely used for image recognition, object detection, and various computer vision tasks. I have implemented and fine-tuned several CNN architectures for different datasets and applications. Each project is accompanied by detailed explanations, code, and relevant documentation.

## 2. LLM (Large Language Models)

The LLM folder comprises projects related to Large Language Models. These models leverage the power of transformer-based architectures and have shown impressive results in natural language processing tasks, including text generation, sentiment analysis, question answering, and machine translation. Here, you can explore my contributions to developing and utilizing state-of-the-art language models, along with examples of their practical applications.

## 3. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

In the EDA folder, you will find projects that focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is a crucial step in the data science process, where we examine and visualize the data to gain insights, understand patterns, and identify potential relationships. My EDA projects cover various domains and datasets, demonstrating my proficiency in extracting meaningful information from data.

## 4. Spark (About PySpark)

The Spark folder is dedicated to projects involving PySpark, the Python library for Apache Spark. Apache Spark is a powerful distributed computing framework used for big data processing and analytics. In this section, I present projects where I have utilized PySpark to perform data transformations, aggregations, and machine learning tasks on large-scale datasets.

## Purpose of this Repository

The primary objective of this repository is to serve as a comprehensive showcase of my AI-related works throughout my career. It is intended to demonstrate my mastery in the field of Data Science, with a special focus on Artificial Intelligence, including Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, and Big Data processing using PySpark. By sharing my projects, I aim to exhibit my problem-solving skills, proficiency in programming, and ability to apply cutting-edge AI techniques to real-world challenges.

Feel free to explore the folders, delve into the projects, and review the code and documentation provided. If you have any questions, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities, please don't hesitate to get in touch. I hope this repository effectively reflects my passion for AI and Data Science and highlights my journey as a Data Scientist with a focus on Artificial Intelligence. Enjoy browsing through my portfolio!
